- ADO Dot NET used to work with database:
	- Establish Connection
	- Prepare SQL Query Command
	- Execute the Commnad
	- Retrieve Data
	- Display Result

- We need Data Providers
	- Used to connect the application to the DB
	- Data providers vary according to DB Vendors(SQL Server, Oracle)
	- Data providers provide abstraction of DB software to Dot Net application

- DataSet
	- Once we connect and get DB data via SQL Query, the data is stores in Dataset
	- It contains collection of one or more data table
	- It's data can be independent of the DB 

- Connection Class
	- Names can be SQLConnection, OracleConnection, etc.
	- Used to connect with DB

- Command Class
	- Names can be SQLCommand, OracleCommand, etc.
	- Provides methods for storing and executing SQL Command and Stored Procedure
	- 'Stored Procedure' is simply collection of SQL Commands to runs multiple SQL commands
	- This class has following methods: 
	- ExecuteReader():
		- Returns data(of 'DataReader' type) to client as rows
	- ExecuteNonQuery(): 
		- Execute command that affect the data in DB
	- ExecuteScalar(): 
		- Returns single value(count of row or a calculated value)

- DataReader Class
	- Names can be SQLDataReader, OracleDataReader, etc.
	- Retrieves data sequencially

- DataAdapter Class
	- Names can be SQLDataAdapter, OracleDataAdapter, etc.
	- Connects DataSets to DB

- DataSet Class
	- Contains data, row and columns







- **************** Coding Guide *******************
- Connect to internet for DataAdapter namespace
- Possible Error: Version of SQL Server and Dot NET should be compatible

- ConnectionString
	- Used to establish connection
	- Contains info like DB Name, Credentials, Host Name

- Use SSMS(SQL Server Management Studio)
	- Has server name is set as PC name
	- Has Window Authentication(Use OS password to enter SQL Server)		// Recommended
	- Has SQL Server Authentication(Use separate password to enter SQL Server) and more
	- Click to 'connect'

	- Right click on 'Database' folder and create New Database
		- Inside your DB, Right click on Table folder and create New Table

- In Visual Studio: 
	- Create a console app (Just for simple practice)
	- Goto Tools-> NuGet Package Manager-> Manage NuGet Packages for Solution
	- Goto 'Browse' tab
	- Install Micrsoft.Data.SQLClient
- Use SQL Server via windows CMD or XAMPP Terminal or phpMyAdmin
